# Flight data analysis

> [!NOTE]
> This is a DSA210 project repository for university. This repository is only relevant to instructors and students who are teaching, learning, about to take or has taken this course.

Information and conclusions drawn from every single flight I've been with enriched details of each flight with older public flight details.

## Why?
Ever since starting university, I've become a frequent flier and I seemed to go on a bunch of flights especially since 2023. I've had an interesting idea of exploring all my past flights and their interesting events using as much data as possible. We are going to use the historical (and available) data that are on the flights I've been on to get an some sort of pattern on these flights.

## Data Sources
-[My flight logs on myFlightradar24](https://my.flightradar24.com/YouTube_101/flights) because I log my flights on that page
-[Historical flight data from Flightera](https://www.flightera.net/) to get accurate timings, route, aircraft, registration information for a specific flight.
-Some other historical flight data sites if necessary.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Since historical flight data is difficult to record and store, The data is available from 2018 to Present Day. This leaves us with 68 accurately tracked and stored flight information.

## Data Analysis
- [ ] Scrape all flight logs from myFlightradar24
- [ ] Scrape all relevant Flightera pages
- [ ] Scrape the flight path of applicable flights
- [ ] Match and merge all flight information into one dataset
- [ ] Visualize/graph merged dataset
- [ ] Answer hypotethical questions

## Hypothetical Questions
- Which airline/airport is the most punctual I've been to?
- Which flights take the longer route to get to their destination?
- Which flights actually get delayed even if there isn't a delay?
- Which routes do the flights take during heavy traffic?
- Which areas in my travel region lack public flight tracking equipment/susceptible to radar jamming?
- ...and more as we go
